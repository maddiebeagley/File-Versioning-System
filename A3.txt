PART 4

If a file is deleted from the mount directory, if all the corresponding versions stored in .versiondir are also deleted, the user will be unable to recover any of their information if they so desire. If the deletion in the mount directory was unintentional, the user will have irreversibly lost all their previous work. However, in the case where the user does intend to delete the file, deleting its corresponding versions will reduce storage space and stop unused files being stored. If at a later date the user wanted to retrieve this data, theywould be unable to do so.
